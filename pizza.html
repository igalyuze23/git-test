        </em> </strong>
        <h2>Toppings</h2>
        <ul>
         
        <em> <strong>
    
        <li> 6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced </li>
        
        <li> ½ teaspoon dried oregano </li>
            
        <li> ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            
        <li> ½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes </li>
            
        <li> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            
        <li> 6 leaves fresh basil, torn </li>
    
        </em> </strong>
    <ol>
      
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <em> <strong>
    <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top.<p> Let stand for 5 minutes.</p> <p> Stir in cold water and salt.</p> <p>Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</p> <p> Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</p> Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls.<p> Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.</p> <p> Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</p> </li>
    <li>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
    <li><p>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).<p> Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</p> </li>
    <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter,<p> or about the size of the pizza stone.</p> <p> Place on the floured peel.</p>
    <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top.<p> Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</p> </li>
    <li>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily.<p> Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</p> </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface.<p> Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza.</p> Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
